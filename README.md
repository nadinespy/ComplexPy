# ComplexPy - a Library for Measures of Emergence & Complexity

This is the repository for a Python library that is supposed to call and apply several measures of emergence and complexity to either empirical or simulated time-series data, and provide guidance for comparisons among and conclusions about different measures (see a description of this project also in this [OLS-4 speed blog: Developing a library in Python for applying measures of emergence and complexity](https://openlifesci.org/posts/2022/03/17/ols-4-participant-nadine-spychala/)). 

It has long been private due to unsettled publications statuses of software used, and has been made public only very recently. For that reason, preparations to make it ready for contributions from others lay dormant. I aim to change this soon, and all necessary info (e. g., contributor's guide) will be included, and further work on the code base that is necessary to have a minimally working library will follow.

# General idea

Measures of complexity operationalize the idea that a system of interconnected parts is both segregated (i.e., parts act independently), and integrated (i.e., parts show unified behaviour). Emergence, on the other hand, is a phenomenon in which a property occurs only in a collection of elements, but not in the individual elements themselves. Both emergence and complexity are promising concepts in the study of the brain (with a close relationship between the two).

Quantifications thereof can take on very different flavours, and there is no one-size-fits-all way to do it. While a plethora of complexity measures have been investigated quite substantially in the last couple of decades (see, e. g., [Wiesner, 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.13243.pdf) for an overview), quantifying emergence is completely new territory. A few measures exist (see, e. g., [dynamical independence](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06511.pdf), or [causal emergence](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008289), but they are not readily implementable - they are scattered over different github repositories (or people, if repositories are not existent), and programming languages (including Matlab which is not open source).

A way to easily use & compare a set of state of the art emergence and complexity measures - in an educated way, using only a few lines of code - is thus missing. This is the gap that Iâ€™d like to fill.

This library will be useful for anyone interested in micro-macro relationships using time-series data.

# Installation

# Examples 

# Citing

# Contribute

Once I have succeeded in releasing a mini-version of the library, I welcome contributions especially from people with software engineering/coding skills, and/or knowledge in information theory & complex systems, and/or a general interest in mathematical/formal micro-macro relationships, and/or a combination of the things just mentioned. Generally, contributions from anyone at any career stage and with any amount of coding experience will be welcome. Both contribution guidelines and Contributor Code of Conduct will be provided once a first release is achieved. 

### Organization of this repository

This repository is adapted from [Shablona](https://github.com/uwescience/shablona), which is a template project for small scientific python projects. It follows the standards and conventions of much of the scientific Python eco-system, making reuse of the code for and collaboration with others easier 

This repository has the following structure:

    complex_py/
      |- README.md
      |- complex_py/
         |- __init__.py
         |- complex_py.py
         |- due.py
         |- data/
            |- ...
         |- tests/
            |- ...
      |- doc/

         |- conf.py
         |- sphinxext/

The core of this library is the code inside of `complex_py/complex_py.py`.

### Module code

The module code is placed in a file called `complex_py.py` in the directory called
`complex_py`. You can type `import complex_py as ecmc` in an
interactive Python session to make the classes and functions defined inside of the
`complex_py.py` file in the `ecmc` namespace. 

    from .complex_py import *

### Project Data

You can create a `complex_py/data` folder in which you can
organize the data. This provides a standard file-system location for
the data at:

    import os.path as op
    import complex_py as sb
    data_path = op.join(sb.__path__[0], 'data')

### Testing

This library uses the ['pytest'](http://pytest.org/latest/) library for
testing. 

To run the tests on the command line, change your present working directory to
the top-level directory of the repository (e.g. `/Users/nadinespy/code/complex_py`),
and type:

    py.test complex_py

This will exercise all of the tests in your code directory. If a test fails, you
will see a message such as:


    complex_py/tests/test_complex_py.py .F...

    =================================== FAILURES ===================================
    ________________________________ test_phiid_wpe ________________________________

      [definition-specific error message]

    complex_py/tests/test_complex_py.py:49: AssertionError
    ====================== 1 failed, 4 passed in 0.82 seconds ======================

You can also use a `Makefile` allowing you to run the tests with more
verbose and informative output from the top-level directory, by issuing the
following from the command line:

    make test

### Styling

### Documentation

This library follows the [numpy docstring standard](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt),
which specifies in detail the inputs/outputs of every function, and specifies how to document additional details, such as references to scientific articles,
notes about the mathematics behind the implementation etc.

### Licensing

This code uses the MIT license. More info can be found in the `LICENSE` file.
