function f = integrand_S (xi)
  %% Usage:  f = integrand_S (xi)
  %%
  %% Computes the value of the integrand for the evidence integral
  %% including S and the prior over xi (see NSB method for 
  %% calculating entropies of discrete pdf's). This produces 
  %% (nonnormalized) <S>. Normalization is the integral of integrand_1.
  %%
  %% In:
  %%     xi  - any matrix, the a priori expectation of S
  %% Globals:
  %%     nsb_kx_quad, nsb_nx_quad - row vectors; exactly kx(i) 
  %%           bins had nx(i) counts;
  %%           IMPORTANT: bins with 0 counts are not indexed
  %%           (that is, there is no nx(i) == 0) 
  %%     nsb_K_quad - number of bins; it can be Inf if the number 
  %%           of bins is unknown and assumed infinite; 
  %%     nsb_mlog_quad -value of the negative log-evidence (action) 
  %%           at the saddle point (will be factored from the integrand 
  %%           to avoid overflows)
  %% Out:
  %%     f   - value of the integrand, same size as xi.
  %%
  %% Depends on:
  %%     mlog_evidence.m, prior_xi.m, meanS.m, B_xiK.m
