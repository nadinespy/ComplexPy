function f = meanS2 (B,kx,nx,K)
  %% Usage:  f = meanS2 (B,kx,nx,K)
  %%
  %% Calucalates the expected (mean) value of the entropy squared
  %% in the a priori measure of the form  [d log(Q)] prod Q^beta
  %% with the data given by nx, kx. The distributions  involved are 
  %% assumed to have K possible outcomes. Note that even though 
  %% the integration variable is xi, the argument of this function 
  %% is B.
  %%
  %% In:
  %%     B   - any matrix B=K*beta, indexing a priori expectation of S
  %%           (integration variable);  
  %%     kx, nx - row vectors; exactly kx(i) bins had nx(i) counts;
  %%           IMPORTANT: bins with 0 counts are not indexed
  %%           (that is, there is no nx(i) == 0), but only for
  %%           consistency with other routines. In principle, this
  %%           routine does not need this check.
  %%     K   - number of bins; it can be Inf if the number of bins is
  %%           unknown and assumed infinite; (scalar)
  %% Out:
  %%     f   - value of the expected square of the entropy; 
  %%           same size as B.
  %%
  %% Depends on:
  %%     polygamma.m, nsbpsi.m
