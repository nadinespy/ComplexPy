function [S_as dS_as D] = asymp_val (path, inname, ...)
  %% Usage:  [S_as, dS_as, D] = 
  %%               asymp_val (path, inname, ... )
  %%
  %% The function parses a given set of preprocessed data files 
  %% with occurence statistics of words of different length and
  %% calculates entropies of distribtions of these words using 
  %% asymptotic formulas in Nemenman, 2002.
  %%
  %% In:
  %%     path   - path to the data files; string.
  %%     inname - generic name of the data files, string. The name of a 
  %%              particular data file that has statistics of 
  %%              words of length i is 
  %%              [inname + '_' + i '.txt'].
  %%              Files are assumed to be created by the software 
  %%              from the module Entropy_Parsing. Their format is:
  %%              [column of nx  column of kx], where nx is the number
  %%              of counts in a bin, and kx is the number of such bins.
  %%              Example:
  %%                 0   4.08846e+61
  %%                 1   1.20610e+06
  %%                 2   50
  %%                 3   55
  %%              The files may or may not contain the enry for nx=0.
  %%     asize  - scalar, alphabet size used to create the files;
  %% Optional arguments:
  %%     fstart - scalar integer, start processing with this word length;
  %%              default value -- 1;
  %%     fend   - scalar integer, stop processing at this word length.
  %%              default value -- process while data is available.
  %%
  %% Out:
  %%     Vectors of calculated entropy estimates are both returned, and 
  %%     also stored in the file with name 
  %%        [inname + 'entr_as.txt']
  %%     in the directory 'path'. The length of all return variables is 
  %%     determined by how many different data files are present, and 
  %%     results for i'th data file are in i'th element of each return
  %%     variable. If mistake occured while processing some file, the
  %%     routine tries to save information calculated for smaller word 
  %%     sizes. 
  %%     S_as    - asymptotic entropy estimate;
  %%     dS_as   - the standard deviation of the estimate;
  %%     D       - number of coincidences;
  %%
  %% Depends on:
  %%   polygamma.m
