function f = mlog_evidence(B, kx, nx, K)
  %% Usage:  f = mlog_evidence (B, kx, nx, K)
  %%
  %% Computes the 'action' (the negative logarithms of the 
  %% evidence) for the integral over ...xi (see NSB method for 
  %% calculating entropies of discrete pdf's). Does not include
  %% the contribution from the prior over ...xi. Note that even though 
  %% the integration variable is ...xi, the argument of this function 
  %% is B.
  %%
  %% In:
  %%     B   - any matrix, the a priori expectation of S
  %%           (integration variable);  
  %%     kx, nx - row vectors; exactly kx(i) bins had nx(i) counts;
  %%           IMPORTANT: bins with 0 counts are not indexed
  %%           (that is, there is no nx(i) == 0) 
  %%     K   - number of bins; it can be Inf if the number of bins is
  %%           unknown and assumed infinite; 
  %% Out:
  %%     f   - value of the negative log-evidence(action); same 
  %%           size as B.

  %% Depends on:
  %%     B_xiK.m, lpoch.m
