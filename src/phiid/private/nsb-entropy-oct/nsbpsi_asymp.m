function f = nsbpsi_asymp (x)
  %% Usage:  f = nsbpsi_aymp (x)
  %%
  %% Subleading asymptotic behavior of Psi (or Digamma) function valid 
  %% for positive argument.
  %%
  %%                       d
  %%        nsbpsi_asymp(x) = --log(Gamma(x)) - log(x)
  %%                       dx
  %%
  %% We aim at extremely large x, so we use the Stirling form for 
  %% nsbpsi, and not the Lancocs one. The stirling form has the log(x) 
  %% term in it, and subtraction of the logarithm can be done with no
  %% loss of precision.
  %%    nsbpsi_asymp(x) = nsbpsi(x) - log(x) = -1/2x 
  %%              - ...sum_{i=1}^{...infty} B_{2i} /(2i*x^{2i}),
  %%
  %% In:
  %%    x - value of the argument, any matrix.
  %% Out:
  %%    f - value of the function, same size as x.
